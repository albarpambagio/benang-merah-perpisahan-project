Okay, here's a to-do list based on the refined implementation plan, designed to guide you through the process of writing your paper for JMST:

**Phase 1: Setup and Initial Drafting**

* **Overall Manuscript Preparation:**
    * [ ] **Obtain JMST Template:** Download the official JMST Word document template.
    * [ ] **Set up Project Folder:** Create a dedicated folder for your manuscript, including subfolders for figures, data (if any used for generating figures in the paper), and your bibliography file.
    * [ ] **Familiarize with Quarto (if using for drafting before template):** Ensure Quarto is set up and you know how to manage content, citations, and potentially export to a format that can be easily transferred to the JMST Word template. *Alternatively, draft directly in the JMST template.*
    * [ ] **Identify 2nd Author (and any others):** Confirm all co-authors and gather their full names and email addresses.

* **Title Page Elements (JMST Template):**
    * [ ] Draft English Title (max 20 words).
    * [ ] Draft Bahasa Indonesia Title (max 20 words).
    * [ ] List all authors' full names (no abbreviations).
    * [ ] List all authors' email addresses.
    * [ ] Add affiliations as per template.

* **Abstract and Keywords (JMST Template):**
    * [ ] Draft English Abstract (max 300 words: Purpose, Data Collecting Technique, Result).

    * [ ] Draft Research Background.
    * [ ] Draft Literature Study/Theories (integrate initial references).
    * [ ] Draft Problem/s Statement.
    * [ ] Draft Purpose of the Paper.
    * [ ] *Self-check: Word count contribution, clarity, flow.*

* **Method (Target: 800-1000+ words):**
    * [ ] Draft Data Source Description.
    * [ ] Draft Data Collection Strategy.
    * [ ] Draft Data Extraction details (tools, process, challenges).

        * [ ] Draft detailed Metadata Schema description (potentially with a summary table in-text and full in appendix).
        * [ ] Draft qualitative description of PDF content (structure, common elements).
    * **Discussion:**
        * [ ] Draft interpretation of descriptive results.
        * [ ] **Expand Literature Search:** Find more sources (to reach 25+ total) to compare your dataset characteristics and preliminary observations against.
        * [ ] Draft comparison of your dataset with literature.
        * [ ] Draft discussion on the significance of your dataset.
        * [ ] Draft discussion on strengths and limitations.
        * [ ] Draft discussion on implications for research (elaborate on potential applications).
    * [ ] *Self-check: Integration of results and discussion, use of tables/figures, critical analysis, word count.*

* **Conclusion (Target: 300-500 words, paragraph form):**
    * [ ] Draft summary of the main result (dataset creation and description).
    * [ ] Draft recommendations/implications for researchers.
    * [ ] Draft recommendations/implications for policy/practice (optional).
    * [ ] Draft concluding thoughts on the dataset's contribution.
    * [ ] *Self-check: No pointers, conciseness, impact.*

**Phase 3: Refinement and Finalization**

* **References (Continued):**
    * [ ] **Ensure Minimum 25 References:** Add more relevant academic sources as needed during drafting.
    * [ ] **Format all references in APA Style** (meticulously).
    * [ ] Double-check all in-text citations match the reference list.

* **Formatting and Word Count:**
    * [ ] **Transfer to JMST Template:** If drafted outside, carefully transfer all content into the JMST Word template, ensuring all formatting (fonts, headings, spacing) matches.
    * [ ] **Page Numbers:** Verify page numbers are correctly placed (middle bottom).
    * [ ] **Word Count Check:** Ensure the total manuscript (including everything) is well over 4000 words. If short, identify sections that can be elaborated further (especially Introduction, Method, and Result & Discussion).
    * [ ] **Review Tables and Figures:** Ensure they are clear, correctly labeled, referenced in the text, and conform to any template guidelines for these elements.

* **Review and Revision:**
    * [ ] **Self-Review (Content):** Read through for clarity, coherence, logical flow, and completeness against the JMST guidelines and your plan.
    * [ ] **Self-Review (Language):** Proofread meticulously for English grammar, spelling, punctuation, and academic tone.
