## Benang Merah Perpisahan: An Analysis of X Indonesian Public Divorce Documents – Refined Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Overview
#### Problem Statement
Despite the high number of divorce cases in Indonesia (463,654 cases in 2023) and the dominance of wife-initiated divorces (75-76% of cases), there is limited comprehensive analysis of the patterns and trends in divorce cases from a data-driven perspective. The current understanding of divorce factors relies heavily on survey-based studies and anecdotal evidence, while the rich information contained in court documents remains largely untapped for systematic analysis.

#### Research Questions
1. **Pattern Analysis**
   - What are the temporal and geographic patterns in divorce filings across Indonesia?
   - How do divorce rates and patterns vary across different regions and courts?
   - What is the relationship between marriage duration and divorce outcomes?

2. **Demographic Factors**
   - How do demographic factors (education, occupation, age) correlate with divorce outcomes?
   - What is the role of children in divorce proceedings and outcomes?
   - How do economic factors manifest in divorce cases?

3. **Legal Process Analysis**
   - What are the common grounds cited in divorce petitions?
   - How do different courts handle similar cases?
   - What is the typical duration from filing to resolution?

4. **Gender Dynamics**
   - What are the differences in filing patterns between husband and wife-initiated divorces?
   - How do settlement patterns differ between gender-initiated cases?
   - What are the common reasons cited in wife-initiated vs. husband-initiated divorces?

#### Project Goals
1. **Primary Goal**: Extract and analyze patterns, trends, and social signals from Indonesian public divorce documents to provide data-driven insights into divorce dynamics.

2. **Specific Objectives**:
   - Create a comprehensive dataset of divorce cases from public court documents
   - Develop automated tools for extracting and analyzing divorce case information
   - Identify patterns in divorce filings, outcomes, and settlements
   - Analyze demographic and geographic factors in divorce cases
   - Provide insights into the legal and social aspects of divorce in Indonesia

3. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - A structured dataset of divorce cases
   - Automated analysis tools for court documents
   - Visualizations of divorce patterns and trends
   - Insights into factors influencing divorce outcomes
   - Recommendations for policy and research
